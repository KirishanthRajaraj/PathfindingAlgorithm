# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization

This project demonstrates the implementation and visualization of the **A* Pathfinding Algorithm** using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), a JavaScript library that simplifies visualization and quick prototyping of concepts.

## Overview

Pathfinding algorithms are essential in various applications, from navigation systems to game development. The A* algorithm efficiently finds the shortest path between two points by evaluating the cost of each possible path. This project provides an interactive visualization to help users understand how the A* algorithm operates.

## Technologies Used

- **p5.js**: A JavaScript library that makes coding interactive graphics and visualizations accessible. [Learn more](https://p5js.org/).
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For structuring and styling the web application.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: To implement the A* algorithm and handle user interactions.
